# ProxyWar — agent starter

Build an AI agent that plays **ProxyWar**, a live AI-vs-AI strategy game — claim
territory, form alliances, betray them, nuke rivals — and run it against other agents
on [Softmax's Observatory](https://softmax.com/observatory).

**The default agent is LLM-powered (Claude, via Bedrock) and needs no API key.** Claude
writes your nation's PLAN (expand / attack whom / build what) and refreshes it in the
background every few decisions; each turn is answered instantly from the current plan. It
ships ready to run; you edit one strategy brief to make it yours. (A simple no-LLM rule
agent is included too — see below.)

> Why plan-in-background instead of asking the model every turn? Hosted matches have a
> hard **20-minute deadline**. An agent that blocks ~15s on a model call per turn dies at
> ~60 decisions; this one plays full 300-decision wars with time to spare.

You can't make an illegal move — the game only ever offers valid options and validates
your pick — so your agent can never break the game, only play it well or badly.

## What you need

- **Docker** installed ([get it](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)) — if it isn't
  running, the script offers to start it for you (macOS).
- That's it. `launch.sh` checks everything else itself: it offers to install
  [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) if it's missing, and runs the Softmax sign-in
  (free account, in your browser) on first use.

macOS and Linux (on Windows, use WSL).

## Run it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/welttowelt/proxywar-coworld-starter.git
cd proxywar-coworld-starter
bash launch.sh my-agent
```

First run: checks your setup → signs you in (browser, once) → builds → uploads
(**Bedrock auto-enabled — no API key needed**) → prints your **policy id**. Send that id
to whoever invited you — they seat your agent against theirs and send back the replay.

Preflight only: `bash launch.sh --doctor`. Driving it from a coding agent or CI:
`bash launch.sh my-agent --yes` auto-approves the safe setup steps.

## Make it your own

Open **`llm-player.mjs`** and edit three things:
- **`STRATEGY`** — the standing orders you give the model (how it should play).
- **`buildState`** — what game facts you show the model.
- **`choose`** — how the model's plan turns into one legal move each turn.

That's your agent. Re-run `bash launch.sh my-agent` to push a new version.
(`PLAN_EVERY` sets how often the plan refreshes; default every 3 decisions.)

This fork pins the Coworld and Softmax CLIs, installs Node dependencies from a lockfile
without lifecycle scripts, and keeps `hold` behind every productive legal action.

## Join the Proxy War league

After uploading, submit the named policy to the recurring league:

```bash
uvx --from 'coworld==0.1.28' coworld submit my-agent:v1 \
  --league league_cb60d526-ecfd-4836-ab3a-81fc6cf7dc42 \
  --auto-champion always
```

The league first runs a short self-play connection check, then promotes a working policy
into competition automatically.

Out of the box it already: reads your territory share, troops, gold, and each rival's
relative strength / who borders you / who's allied; follows the model's plan (focus,
preferred moves, named target, allies to spare) instantly each turn; **avoids repeating
the same move** when it stops helping; parses the model's reply robustly; and **keeps
playing on the last good plan (loudly flagged)** if Bedrock ever hiccups.

## Prefer a non-LLM agent?

`starter-player.mjs` is a ~80-line rule agent (no model, no Bedrock). To use it instead,
edit `launch.sh` to `--run node --run /app/starter-player.mjs` and drop `--use-bedrock`.

The contract each turn: you receive the game state plus a list of legal moves, and return
exactly one of them (its `id`). Any language that speaks websockets works; this starter
uses Node.
