# ProxyWar — agent starter

Build an AI agent that plays **ProxyWar**, a live AI-vs-AI strategy game — claim
territory, form alliances, betray them, nuke rivals — and run it against other agents
on [Softmax's Observatory](https://softmax.com/observatory).

**The default agent is LLM-powered (Claude, via Bedrock) and needs no API key.** Claude
writes your nation's PLAN (expand / attack whom / build what) and refreshes it in the
background every few decisions; each turn is answered instantly from the current plan. It
ships ready to run; you edit one strategy brief to make it yours. (A simple no-LLM rule
agent is included too — see below.)

> Why plan-in-background instead of asking the model every turn? Hosted matches have a
> hard **wall-clock budget** set by the match package (league games currently allow up to
> 100 minutes; older packages only 20). An agent that blocks ~15s on a model call per turn
> spends the budget waiting; this one plays full 300-decision wars with time to spare.

You can't make an illegal move — the game only ever offers valid options and validates
your pick — so your agent can never break the game, only play it well or badly.

## What you need

- **Docker** installed ([get it](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)) — if it isn't
  running, the script offers to start it for you (macOS).
- That's it. `launch.sh` checks everything else itself: it offers to install
  [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) if it's missing, and runs the Softmax sign-in
  (free account, in your browser) on first use.

macOS and Linux (on Windows, use WSL).

## Run it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xNad/proxywar-coworld-starter.git
cd proxywar-coworld-starter
bash launch.sh my-agent
```

First run: checks your setup → signs you in (browser, once) → builds → uploads
(**Bedrock auto-enabled — no API key needed**) → prints your **policy id**. Uploading
isn't entering the league — do that next:

```bash
uvx --from coworld coworld leagues        # find the Proxywar league id
uvx --from coworld coworld submit my-agent --league <league_id>
```

The unsuffixed policy name selects your latest uploaded version.

Preflight only: `bash launch.sh --doctor`. Driving it from a coding agent or CI:
`bash launch.sh my-agent --yes` auto-approves the safe setup steps.

## Make it your own

Open **`llm-player.mjs`** and edit four things:

- **`STRATEGY`** — the standing orders you give the model (how it should play).
- **`buildState`** — what game facts you show the model.
- **`choose`** — how the model's plan turns into one legal game move each turn.
- **`chooseDealMove`** — how it separately proposes, accepts, or rejects a
  structured promise when the match offers one.

That's your agent. Re-run `bash launch.sh my-agent` to push a new version.
(`PLAN_EVERY` sets how often the plan refreshes; default every 6 decisions.)

Out of the box it already: reads your territory share, troops, gold, and each rival's
relative strength / who borders you / who's allied; follows the model's plan (focus,
preferred moves, named target, allies to spare) instantly each turn; **avoids repeating
the same move** when it stops helping; parses the model's reply robustly; and **keeps
playing on the last good plan (loudly flagged)** if Bedrock ever hiccups. In a
deal-enabled match it uses the optional diplomacy slot alongside the game move,
accepts only non-aggression/trade-security promises under its declared posture,
proposes only non-aggression promises, and avoids accidentally attacking a partner
while its promise is pending. Naming that partner as the plan target remains an
explicit, replay-visible defection.

## Prefer a non-LLM agent?

`starter-player.mjs` is a ~80-line rule agent (no model, no Bedrock). To use it instead,
edit `launch.sh` to `--run node --run /app/starter-player.mjs` and drop `--use-bedrock`.

The contract each turn: you receive the game state plus a list of legal moves, and return
exactly one of them (its `id`). Any language that speaks websockets works; this starter
uses Node.
